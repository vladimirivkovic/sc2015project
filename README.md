## Protein Structure Prediction

*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

Constituent amino-acids can be analyzed to predict secondary, tertiary and quaternary protein structure.
Protein structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence â€” that is, the prediction of its folding and its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure from its primary structure. Structure prediction is fundamentally different from the inverse problem of protein design. Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by bioinformatics and theoretical chemistry; it is highly important in medicine (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology (for example, in the design of novel enzymes). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the CASP experiment (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction).
